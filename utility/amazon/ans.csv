"Feels great first thing in the morning!","My face often feels hot in the morning and my eyes are sometimes puffy. This feels great to roll over my face and chest when I wake up. I love holding the roller on my eyes and hearing the crackle of the ice. It stays cool for a good amount of time, I wish it stayed 'cold' longer but I still love it. Other reviews mentioned the squeakiness of the roller and I experienced that as well. In fact, so much so that I planned to return it because it was so annoying. But I decided to try something first. I put a little bit of olive oil on my finger and rubbed it in to the grooves where the roller sits and it worked! That was several weeks ago and it hasn't squeaked since!","05 Feb 2023","Color: Two roller - Purple","","Yes","Stephanie House","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=0"

Nothing else she tried worked. So I told her to keep it and ordered another one for me. My lower back and neck have been really stiff and sore and as soon as the roller was ready I used it.

"Good for giving yourself a nice facial - not helpful when you have a migraine","I bought this bc of buzzfeed and their top tiktok purchases. I don’t TikTok. I do read buzzfeed. I get horrible migraines. I must put something on my face when I get them. I got this to help. It doesn’t help migraines. I will continue to use my gel mask for that. I do use this when it’s hot AF outside and for some reason my husband has the heat on 71 and I’m sweating. Like in shorts and a bra and dripping sweat after putting away some clothes from the laundry. I say this would be good for when I cry a lot and don’t want to look like a hot mess the next day for video calls. This is good for when I’m sweaty and need to cool the heck down. This is good to roll over a sore muscle. I wouldn’t buy it again. I’ll buy a gel face mask for my eyes to wear while bracing myself to weather a 3 day migraine. This is a beauty aid that comes in a bunch of cute color ways, not a migraine aid.","28 Nov 2022","Color: Two roller - Purple","","Yes","Ami","3.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=2"

"Needs to be ""unstuck"" to get going","I ordered this ESARORA Ice Roller because I was going to be having a procedure done at my dermatologist's office, and wanted to have an ice roller to use afterwards because it would be easier, and better, than holding an ice pack. I chose the ESARORA Ice Roller over other offerings for two reasons: (1) more ratings, and (2) it comes with a second roller insert thingy (technical term). I placed my order on July 5, and as a Prime member, I was assured delivery would be on July 7.  Pefect.  On July 9 it still had not been delivered, and I was receiving messages from Amazon that they didn't know when it would be delivered, that it may be lost, and if I still didn't have it in two more days, I could cancel the order.  Instead, I ordered an Ice Roller by SPANLA 2, that also came with a spare roller (and was more than $10 less expensive).  The SPANLA 2 Ice Roller was delivered on July 11, and later that day the ESARORA Ice Roller was delivered.  Of course. At any rate, I decided to keep both of them because who knows when we might have a need for more than one at a time... (and it's a pain in the patoot to return things). After my procedure at the dermatologist's office, I came home and used to ESARORA Ice Roller.  It worked great, but to get it going, I had to ""unstick"" the roller.  It froze in place.  I sort of expected that, because the Ice Roller I was given to use while still at the doctor's office did the same thing.  So, if you get one of these, be sure to make sure that the roller will actually roll/turn before you put it against whatever part of your body you're using it on. Oh, by the way, the Ice Roller the dermatologist's office had me use was a SPANLA 2!!  AND, having gotten both brands delivered on the same day, it was interesting to compare the boxes and the written instruction sheet.  They're made by the same company.","22 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Just My Opinion","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=3"
