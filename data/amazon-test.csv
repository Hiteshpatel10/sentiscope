"Feels great first thing in the morning!","My face often feels hot in the morning and my eyes are sometimes puffy. This feels great to roll over my face and chest when I wake up. I love holding the roller on my eyes and hearing the crackle of the ice. It stays cool for a good amount of time, I wish it stayed 'cold' longer but I still love it. Other reviews mentioned the squeakiness of the roller and I experienced that as well. In fact, so much so that I planned to return it because it was so annoying. But I decided to try something first. I put a little bit of olive oil on my finger and rubbed it in to the grooves where the roller sits and it worked! That was several weeks ago and it hasn't squeaked since!","05 Feb 2023","Color: Two roller - Purple","","Yes","Stephanie House","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=0"

"Good for giving yourself a nice facial - not helpful when you have a migraine","I bought this bc of buzzfeed and their top tiktok purchases. I don’t TikTok. I do read buzzfeed. I get horrible migraines. I must put something on my face when I get them. I got this to help. It doesn’t help migraines. I will continue to use my gel mask for that. I do use this when it’s hot AF outside and for some reason my husband has the heat on 71 and I’m sweating. Like in shorts and a bra and dripping sweat after putting away some clothes from the laundry. I say this would be good for when I cry a lot and don’t want to look like a hot mess the next day for video calls. This is good for when I’m sweaty and need to cool the heck down. This is good to roll over a sore muscle. I wouldn’t buy it again. I’ll buy a gel face mask for my eyes to wear while bracing myself to weather a 3 day migraine. This is a beauty aid that comes in a bunch of cute color ways, not a migraine aid.","28 Nov 2022","Color: Two roller - Purple","","Yes","Ami","3.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=2"

"Needs to be ""unstuck"" to get going","I ordered this ESARORA Ice Roller because I was going to be having a procedure done at my dermatologist's office, and wanted to have an ice roller to use afterwards because it would be easier, and better, than holding an ice pack. I chose the ESARORA Ice Roller over other offerings for two reasons: (1) more ratings, and (2) it comes with a second roller insert thingy (technical term). I placed my order on July 5, and as a Prime member, I was assured delivery would be on July 7.  Pefect.  On July 9 it still had not been delivered, and I was receiving messages from Amazon that they didn't know when it would be delivered, that it may be lost, and if I still didn't have it in two more days, I could cancel the order.  Instead, I ordered an Ice Roller by SPANLA 2, that also came with a spare roller (and was more than $10 less expensive).  The SPANLA 2 Ice Roller was delivered on July 11, and later that day the ESARORA Ice Roller was delivered.  Of course. At any rate, I decided to keep both of them because who knows when we might have a need for more than one at a time... (and it's a pain in the patoot to return things). After my procedure at the dermatologist's office, I came home and used to ESARORA Ice Roller.  It worked great, but to get it going, I had to ""unstick"" the roller.  It froze in place.  I sort of expected that, because the Ice Roller I was given to use while still at the doctor's office did the same thing.  So, if you get one of these, be sure to make sure that the roller will actually roll/turn before you put it against whatever part of your body you're using it on. Oh, by the way, the Ice Roller the dermatologist's office had me use was a SPANLA 2!!  AND, having gotten both brands delivered on the same day, it was interesting to compare the boxes and the written instruction sheet.  They're made by the same company.","22 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Just My Opinion","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=3"

"Great Price - Great Product!","Uses and Benefits I have been using the ESARORA Ice Roller for almost a month now and it has changed my daily routine for the better. It has multiple uses that I have found to be extremely helpful for my eyes, headaches, and skin. First, this has improved the puffiness under my eyes tremendously. I have found myself struggling to get an adequate amount of sleep and waking up with major bags under my eyes. But keeping this product in either the fridge or freezer and rolling it under my eyes in the morning has helped the puffiness go down. Second, this has been a miracle for sinus headaches. Living in the Midwest, the winters are brutal and so are my sinus infections. This ice roller instantly relieves the pressure and pain I feel on my face from the infection. Lastly, my skin has transformed drastically since using this product. I have always struggled with irritating texture and large pores. Since I started using this, I noticed my pores have gotten noticeably smaller which makes the days of not wearing makeup that much better! After using this product, I immediately told my close friends and family about it. My mother, my grandmother and I all struggle with sinus infections and pain so I knew that they had to buy it. They both love it as much as I do, for sinus pain and their skin! I think men and women of all ages can find great uses for this product. Durability The ice roller came in great packaging and was sealed very well. It was extremely easy to put together. All I had to do was clean the roller head first and store it in a bag in the fridge or freezer. Once it was cold, it was very east to attach the roller head to the handle. The roller handle feels very high quality and I know that it will last me a very long time. Price Ordering this ice roller on Amazon saved me so much money. I have Amazon Prime, so I was able to get this product for only $11.99! In my opinion, that price cannot be beat. Other face rollers that I have seen have ranged from $15-$30 which does not even compare to this ice roller. I truly do not know what I did without this product in my life! I highly recommend you get your hands on this product!","07 Feb 2019","Color: Blue","","Yes","EW","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=4"

"BEST Amazon impulse buy so far.","I get pressure headaches with some weather changes. Hard to predict. I told the Dr. They were weather retaliated but she wasn’t sure they weren’t migraines so we tried some different types of medications. NONE helped. So no reason to keep taking them. The ONLY two things seems to help. 2. wrapping a TIGHT band around my head (sometimes problematic with hair and probably not too wise to keep something wrapped tightly around your head for too long!) and 2. holding a mug filled with ice (and covered with “press & seal”) against my eye socket. That kept the ice cold the longest and gave me relief. When I found this I thought it would be easier than prepping those ice mugs and HOORAY… this is really HANDY!  Something about the rolling pressure and being able to use it all over my face it truly did help quite a lot! Will be something I would even consider traveling with if I’m staying long enough with a freezer available since often different geographical locations have different pressure (and flying etc.) adds to the pressure changes.","19 Sep 2021","Color: Green","","Yes","Arty Girl","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=6"

"not a gimmick","honestly through these rollers we’re just gimmicks and i wasn’t going to spend the money. This summer being one of the hottest ever where I live i decided to give it a shot . worst case situation i’ve spent a lot more money on products that didn’t work. I keep it in my beauty to mini fridge that has a little freezer built in. after letting it chill for 2 days i decided to try it. I used on my face after using my toner and serum and holy amazing. the coolness soothes my irritated skin and instantly calmed down all the puffiness. I tend to sweat after showers in the summer and have severe dry itchy skin. I used after my lotion on my legs and arms and for the first time all summer had relief from the itch on my legs. I had epilated my legs and had a bad reaction as well as horrible i’m grown hairs that just made things worse. the cortisone cream was just thick and greasy and only provided relief briefly. this roller however along with some light lotion from cerave for itch relief (the red bottle ) works like a charm after ever shower. also rolled it over my husbands back of neck and head as he had almost passed out from mowing the lawn in the heat and even he was impressed.","18 Aug 2020","Color: Two roller - Grey","","Yes","Shauneezy","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=7"

"Jack of all Trades","This roller is great.  I initially got it to help reduce eye puffiness (hellooo crying eyes).  I now use it most mornings while I am drinking my coffee to help reduce the overnight swelling and to help wake me up.  In addition, I suffer from migraines and this ice roller is a wonderful tool to use if a cold compress is something that soothes your migraines.  I will sometimes hold the ice roller over whichever eye is throbbing with pain the most.  Lastly, this year I got clocked in the head by a German Shepard, the cut was pretty bad (probably should have gotten stitches), and once it started to heal I used this ice roller on it to help with the healing process and I can barely see the mark on my forehead.  This tool is definitely a jack of all trades.  In the 8 or so months that I have been using this, I only had one issue.  The sides on the roller started to slide out and the liquid inside the roller oozed out a bit.  It was a simple fix of  popping the plastic pieces back where they needed to be and it was good to go!","31 Dec 2020","Color: Green","","Yes","Jenni","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=7"

"Happy but could be a touch happier 😁","So I got this because I have rosacea and my face gets so hot and painful. It does help with pain relief! It feels good and refreshing. I am a little disappointed because based on the pictures and the beads I thought it would be squishy but it is hard plastic. There is no give at all to get nicely around eyes and nose. It was a little leaky out of the package as you can see in the picture. I gave it a quick wash which I would have anyway. I started with storing in the fridge and it felt good that way. I froze it and it was pretty cold but still refreshing and not too cold in my opinion. It stays cold for long enough. Maybe 30 min to pushing it to an hour? And I've left it out twice overnight and no additional leakage. When deciding if I should purchase I wasn't sure that it would be easy to hold and use but it's not bad at all. If you have soft slippery hands (like my dad even though he worked with his hands his whole life) and things slide out of your hands I would not get this. So overall I would do 3.5 out of 5 stars. I see some improvements that could be made but for now, my face says thank you!","25 Nov 2019","Color: Purple","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uIb5U2KXL._SY88.jpg

"Works great!","So far I have bought a total of 3 and am considering buying 1 or 2 more just as gifts. (But if I do, I'll probably just keep those too!) These are wonderful for headaches, migraines, minor aches, flushed cheeks, overheated or feverish faces, to close pores, to ease stress in the neck and shoulders, and so much more! They are exactly as pictured, come in perfect condition and roll smoothly. This is my favorite because it comes with 2 types of rollers. (Definitely get the one that has the 2 types of rollers!) The metal gets icy and warms quicker than the gel bead roller. The gel bead roller stays cold for a good while. Both feel great on the skin and roll smoothly with no squeaky sounds. We keep all of the rollers in the freezer and keep the handles safely in a drawer close by. We use them all the time, so buying more than 1 was a necessity. If you really want to chill your skin for a long time, then I suggest buying more than one and just change the rollers when they get warm. Or if there is a chance a family member may take yours, then definitely buy more than one! This really helps with our migraines and when we get overheated in the garden. Hmmm, with the hot weather coming to Florida, I probably should buy a few more. I definitely recommend this item. Oh, I bought all blue handled rollers so everyone shares equally. There's no chance of hearing ""that's my handle"", because they are all the same. Just a helpful tip for ya'.","01 May 2019","","","Yes","Renee Resseau","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=8"

"Get This, If You're Looking to Apply Cold to Your Face/Body","I bought this to apply cold to my eyes which get puffy.  After putting this is the freezer, it becomes the perfect tool for applying cold to my eyes.  I simply take it and hold it to around my eyes. The cold seems just right - it's definitely cold, but it's not overwhelming, like placing ice or placing frozen meet is.  When I place ice on my face, I can only hold it there so long before it becomes a little painful - like pins pricking me.  That doesn't happen with this roller. The other really nice thing that I've found is that it holds the cold for a looooong time.  In fact, I'm not quite sure when the metal on the roller becomes warm because I usually get bored (or tired) of holding it to my face before it ever gets cold.

"I'm in love with this thing!","I had been debating getting different types of face rollers (jade, quartz, steel, etc.) but I'm so glad I went with this one! I had heard the jade and even the steel ones don't stay cold that long after rolling on your face for a while. I figured since this one had water/gel inside, then it would stay cold for longer. I rolled my face for a whole HOUR and it was still cold afterwards. My skin has been looking so much better, more even skin tone. I think this in combination with my serums has made my skin incredibly smooth too. I woke up the next day and couldn't stop feeling how smooth my skin was. ONLY downside I have with this is the size of the roller. It doesn't fit well in the undereye area but I can get past that. I was still able to use it on my eyes. It just took a little bit of maneuvering. My eye bags and undereye discoloration has also improved greatly with the use of this ice roller and I've only used it 3 times. Seriously, GET THIS ROLLER.","10 Dec 2020","Color: Blue","","Yes","Cindy","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=8"

"Refreshing, relaxing and rejuvenating way to spend 5 minutes every morning","I saw other people talking about this online, and for the price, I thought it was worth a shot. Sort of a low-cost treat yourself. I've only had it for a couple days and its a huge hit in the house. I've been using Jade rollers for a while, but even keeping them in the freezer, they lose their coldness rather quickly. The roller on this item is rather large and filled with a gel that freezes partially so once you roll it on your face its both firm and soft a the same time. over 30 minutes outside of the freezer and its still frozen and cold. I've found myself using it after applying skin care in the morning while drinking my tea. Its so refreshing and relaxing, I feel like I could keep rolling a lot longer than the 5 minutes I give myself. My husband gave it a try and loved it as well. I think it will also be helpful for muscle aches and minor injuries that you could traditionally just lay an ice pack on. I think this would make a great gift for the hard-to-buy for person as well. And with the price point you can't go wrong. I'm really happy with this purchase.","22 Feb 2020","Color: White","","Yes","mb756","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=9"

"Just dreamy — and redemption when you just can't NOT touch a blemish","I love this thing. It has a ton of uses and is perfect in so many ways. The roller freezes, but the outside silicone keeps it from sticking to your skin. It doesn't pull on your skin at all. Super gentle. Because of the rolling motion, you are doing on-and-off cold, which is better and more pleasant than constant cold. The roller itself detaches from the handle, which is great for washing it. I usually keep the whole thing in the freezer so I can lie it on its back and have the roller not touching anything inside the freezer. Best uses I've discovered: 1) Calming my skin down after picking at it. OK, so you're not supposed to pick at your face or squeeze anything, but sometimes you just can't resist. This is magic for that — like icing an injury, so it reduces any redness and seems to help everything get back to normal faster. It's the face equivalent of having a glass of water after night drinking — the damage is done, but might as well try to help however I can. 2) Headaches/migraines. Feels amazing on your face and on the back of your neck. The roller gives your face a mini massage and the cool really helps. Pain meds, then a dark room lying down with this thing and you're on your way back to normal. 3) After peels/drying masks/dermarolling. Again with cooling your skin down, but it helps with recovery, especially if you left your peel/mask on a little too long. Calms redness after dermarolling and helps begin the recovery process. Basically you're fighting inflammation.","07 Apr 2018","Color: Blue","","Yes","Caroline","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=10"

"Nice, I really like it (update love it more a year later).","This is very good. I haven't used the metal ones but t his is more like plastic with something gel in it. It stays cold a long time. It's too cold. It's easy to massage aching spots (ie. neck or shoulder) or de-puff face in the morning.  Nice as a moving ice pack. I stubbed my toe. I didn't want to hold a dripping ice cube against it. I just rolled this over the area. Does squeak some, but doesn't bother me. UPDATE: A year later and still using it for many things.  Most recently I fell and hurt toe, ankle and knee, making icing all difficult. I did use ice cubes on some of it. Packs were too heavy and hurt. So I used this and rolled over areas. At first it's not so cold and then it is.  I watched a whole movee and kept putting it down and picking it up and rolling different spots. It stayed cold for hours.  I love it to depuff eyes and calm facial redness. I found that if used over makeup it buffs it in. I have sensitive skin so can't buff heavily.  It really pushesit into my moisturizer and sunscreen so it looks like my skn.  Squeaks a bit, sometimes but not consistantly or to annoyance.  Not so cold that it stick and freezes the skin like mental can, yet stays cold so long. Easy to clean and then I put it back in the freezer in a zip lock.","11 Nov 2017","Color: Blue","","Yes","HL","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=11"

"Amazing for sinus!","I have cat and dust allergies, along with a bad sinus, so I wanted a more natural way to deal with it instead of taking a bunch of meds. This ice roller is perfect to combat both. I like the fact that I have a gel and stainless steel roller that I can alternate. The stainless steel roller does squeak and make a lot of noise, so that's annoying, but the gel one is amazing! Every morning and night, I just use the ice roller on my face - you have to use it for at least 5-10 minutes for it to really work though, and I feel a lot better! Every time my sinus hurts or I have a puffy face or itchy eyes, I just use the ice roller, and it definitely helps quickly. If I skip a day or two, I can definitely feel the effects of not using the ice roller. Plus, not sure, but I think my jawline is more defined.

Otherwise, the ""bag"" that they give you to put the roller piece in is just a very thin, unsealable plastic sheath, not an actual cloth bag or anything, so you would do better to put it in a Ziploc or something else.

"I love this facial roller!!!","This works great. I’ve heard so much about facial rollers and have been wanting to try one. This one is very easy to use and the roller pops in and out easily so I can keep it in the freezer. I found a quick how-to video on YouTube and I was ready to go. A full facial massage takes about 5 minutes and I’m amazed at the results.  I’ve tried every cream and remedy imaginable and nothing has helped my relentless undereye bags.  Within 2 days of using this (two times a day) my bags went down considerably, my skin feels smoother and my entire neck and face feels revitalized. These rollers have been used in Asian cultures for centuries and they’ve been gaining more and more popularity in this country. I can see why. I’ve spent so much money in my lifetime buying so many high priced eye and face creams and I’ve never experienced results like this. It de-puffed my eyes considerably the first time I used it. It’s great for those mornings when you wake up with a puffy face and eyes. It’s great for when you need to get dressed quickly and your eyes are all puffy. It’s quite affordable and It’s made well (I actually dropped the roller twice while it was frozen and it did not crack).

"This thing is BANANAS!!! Incredibly satisfying. I did not know I was getting THIS or I would have gotten one a long time ago","Whoa...I had no idea. This thing is AMAZING. I got it, took it out of the box and for a split second I thought I’d been had, it’s just weird plastic, holding it in my hand and seeing what it is, I never in a million years would think it does what it does. I haven’t tried it chilled yet but there in my kitchen, just took it out of the box, I rolled it over my face and neck. It is really REALLY....NICE.  Surprisingly SATISFYING. I stood there in my kitchen rolling for about 15 min! In fact just talking about it ...makes me want to roll RIGHT NOW! Yes it’s like that. THEN after you stop, it makes your face tingle in an extremely pleasant way, for a good ten min. I would do it just for those reasons but the fact you tingle like that mean circulation is happening which is great for your skin. I am predicting a win win. I had no idea it was like THIS. I even made my boyfriend try it, to make sure it wasn’t just me but he had the same experience.

"Wonderful and relaxing","I have been drooling over one of these for a while now so I finally decided I needed to just buy it! I am so very glad that I did! It is cold but very relaxing and since you keep it moving, it does not get the chance to get too cold like an ice pack would. I love that I can remove the roller and keep it in the freezer and it is ready whenever I need it. I have fibromyalgia but also train in martial arts regularly so I never know when I might need to use this. It works well for sore muscles, a strained neck or just to melt the day's stress away. The handle is a sturdy but lightweight plastic and the roller is hard. when I first read the description I thought the gel would make the roller give a little but it is completely contained inside the roller. It also does not get super wet and drip water down your face as you are suing it. I like that a lot! Ice packs always sweat and can be very messy. I will buying more of these for gifts as they are perfect for anyone. Even my husband enjoys using it an as we get older, we could all use a little pampering.","18 Aug 2016","Color: Purple","","Yes","martialartist","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=15"

"Very nice roller","I did not buy this for any of the claimed beauty enhancements or skin improvements, so I can't speak to that aspect of the roller. I did get it for my migraines, because it helps to have something cold on me forehead and cheeks when they are occurring. For that, this is more than adequate. It stays cold for a while after you take it out of the freezer, and it doesn't get too cold where it would be uncomfortable to put on your bare skin. It really helps ease the pain a bit, which is really all I wanted. This product is great! I do with it came with some sort of germ protection, so you wouldn't just have to put it bare into your freezer. I just put it in a plastic bag, but it would be nice if something came with it.

"Must Have Gadget for Happy Skin","I am a licensed esthetician and recommend that all my clients keep one of these ice rollers. They are also a huge part of the Acne Clearing Program at my studio. I also use these in various treatments I offer. Using extreme cold properly (slow but constant motion) can significantly reduce inflammation. Inflammation is at the root of so many skin care concerns, and long-term inflammatory conditions actually break down our important skin proteins (collagen, elastin) leading to skin damage and aging. For breakout prone skin, cold is one of the best and least expensive ways to lessen the severity and number of breakouts (along with a proper skin care regimen of course). My acne clients are instructed to work with icing of the skin 2x daily. My aging clients once or twice daily based on skin condition. The body also recognizes the cold and sends fresh blood to the area - leaving you with beautifully radiant skin. I love these rollers because they stay cold for a good amount of time, are easy to disinfect (which you should do after every use), and extremely affordable. This can be one of the most useful - and cheap - aspects of your skin care regimen!","19 Aug 2018","Color: Purple","","Yes","SkinPro","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=16"

"great for migraine relief","This is my new favorite item. It has helped to relieve my migraines before they have the chance to set in.  Its also great to cool off from a hot day outside.  The blue roller is a hard plastic which I didn't expect but causes no issue with the product.  I opted to get both blue and steel rollers.  While the steel roller starts off much colder, it warms quicker than the blue roller.  The rollers are a good size for both face and body, however they are a bit big to get the undereye area perfectly but it is possible to use it for this.

I was a bit apprehensive that it would work, but gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised that it did seem to minimize my cheek and chin pores.  Another bonus was that it minimized puffiness under my eyes from lack of sleep.  I have tried all of the other pore/puffiness reduction methods; cucumbers, tea bags, Benefit Puff Off, Peter Thomas Roth Pore Putty, and Tony Moly Cooling Eye stick.  This product has worked much better than any of those mentioned.  I place it in the fridge every night before bed and use it every morning before beginning my makeup routine. This product is also very helpful for sinus headaches. With the fall approaching my allergies have been going crazy.  I pulled this tool out of the fridge and used it to massage my head and sinus areas.  It did work in minimizing my headache and soothed my inflamed sinus areas. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to minimize pores, reduce puffy under eye areas, and / or soothe sinus headache and pressure.","15 Sep 2016","Color: Purple","","Yes","Pammiem","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=17"

This is not cosmetic surgery that eliminated my bags but it is the absolute best thing that has worked in combination with eye cream. PLUS it’s super soothing for headaches and reducing overall face swelling. MOREOVER if you have sensitive skin or use any face treatments that can irritate skin you absolutely need this!

It drastically reduces inflammation and swelling...thereby leaving the skin in a much healthier state than if I didn't use it. I actually prefer this to my magic globes because of the ease of rolling over the skin. Globes tend to skip/jump if the skin is not properly lubricated with a lot of product. I can apply a calming colloidal oatmeal masque (in powder form) or other setting masque and simply roll right over it. If it is too chilly for your client...simply put a damp esti wipe on the skin as a barrier.

It rolls smoothly over my head, face, and neck and I found it really soothing. My medication wasn’t touching my headache last night but the roller brought me relief. I kept it on hand for over an hour rolling my temples, cheek bones, and neck. It never began to feel warm, no condensation dripping so it didn’t make my hair wet as I rolled those parts of my head. I’m really impressed!! Ordering one for my sister and father next. The handle could be more comfortable- I won’t deny that- but I didn’t find it unusable.

It doesn’t get watery or “sweat.” It’s easy to clean - I wash the roller and keep it in a ziplock bag.

However, it’s fun to use and feels great on my face in the mornings.","14 Oct 2020","Color: Blue","","Yes","Sarah","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=20"
"Everyone in my family uses it","Before I had this roller, I used to collect ice cubes into a Ziplock bag and use that instead. Needless to say this roller is way more convenient. It stays cold for a LONG time. I remember using it for 30-45 minutes until my face would no longer feel the cold, and I would think it got warm. Not a chance. Try it quickly on your arm after 45 minutes and see what I mean. Depuffs face easily and it's really smooth. I bring it with me on all my vacations too.","12 Jan 2021","Color: Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8167J0U8H3L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Amazonian","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=20"

It's fantastic for sore, tight muscles, and it's even better for skin reactions such as bug bites, reactions to makeup or facial lotions/serums - I have somewhat sensitive skin and occasionally will have a reaction to a facial product, causing my face to become hot and bright red. I used this roller to cool it down and it was amazing. It really felt so good, and calmed my skin immediately. It's quite relaxing, too. We keep the roller in a small plastic bag in the freezer and just pop it onto the handle as needed; I do clean it off afterwards, especially if I've rolled it across wet product on my face.

"1 week test review","I love this product and usually used it for my skin care routine. It helps tighten up my skin and somewhat reduced the uneven skin tone and acne scars. I also see that my skin got brighter. Only cons, maybe only for me, is the steel one doesn't work as great as the regular green one. It doesn't hold the coldness for that long. I tested both of them in 2 different days, the green one could last up to an hour out of the freeze but the steel only for 15 mins. Great product tho :) maybe they should make a smaller version to targetted deep corners","25 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Vy L.

It is the perfect temperature of cold so that it is tolerable but still very cool. I also love how smoothly it rolls, it almost feels like a wet cold but there is absolutely no wetness left behind, which I just love!  It is easy to use on many places on the face, neck, temples, it even feels nice rolled gently right over the eyes which feels great during a migraine. It couldn't be easier to store and use. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers with migraines.

"Works great on puffy eyes!","Admittedly, I didn’t REALLY feel like this did much the first few times I used it. But then one morning, after a particularly sleepless and exhausting night-I had terrible bags under my eyes (which doesn’t usually happen to me), and my eyes were very puffy....so I used the ice roller mostly on and around my eyes to help bring down some of the puffiness. Within 20min it was gone completely and didn’t come back. I also use it when I feel myself getting a headache. So it definitely DOES work, and it’s very soothing to use when you’re feeling stressed-I wouldn’t expect long term skin changes from using this-but for short term reduction in puffiness or swelling, it’s a great product!","05 Feb 2020","Color: Green","","Yes","Lexy","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=22"

This has come in very handy for helping puffiness go down and to tighten the look of my face. I was worried it would be too big for my eye area (it would be nice if they had a smaller one for just that!), but it can roll right over my eye area horizontally, or up to the bottom of the eye vertically, and it's comfortable and feels nice.

"MUST BUY!!!","Finally!!! As I've gotten older I've noticed significant bags under my eyes. I gave no idea where they came from. They started to appear about 3 years ago. I used to be able to cover them enough with makeup. Unfortunately the makeup trick stopped working after a while.  I have purchased countless lotions, serums etc in an effort to reduce. I was skeptical when I saw this product as nothing else has worked. It arrived today. After 5 minutes of rolling and applying the cold to my eyes I went to look in the bathroom mirror expecting no results as with other products. I am SHOCKED!

"Very refreshing","I really love this thing! I keep the roller in a ziplock bag in the freezer and I wash it after each use. I use the roller every morning. It’s a really great way to help me wake up each morning, which is one of the main reasons I got it in the first place. I’m really slow to wake up! It’s super easy to use, easy to clean, and as far as I can tell it’s exactly the same as the more expensive ones. I also used it recently when I had a bad reaction from a skincare product I used, and it felt amazing. I even used the roller as an ice pack for a tooth ache! As far as noticeable cosmetic skin benefits, I haven’t noticed any yet, but I will update this review later if I do.

I’m a very happy camper! I apply Arnica gel & my skin care products to my face first & then use the ice roller for about 10 minutes twice a day.

"AMAZING! LOVE IT!!","Of all the beauty tools I've purchased over the years this one is a standout.  Put it in the freezer, roll over your face after washing (but before toner, serums, etc) and start (and finish) your day with a minute of zen.  In addition to being relaxing, I think it's helping with the puffiness under my eyes and somehow my pores seem smaller.  OH - and using this on your temples when you have a headache? Two thumbs WAY up!!!  The material is durable but honestly, even if it breaks 6 months from now  - replacing it wouldn't be a big deal and I would do it in a second. For the dollar amount, it's really a no-brainer. I happened to find out about these from an Instagram make-up video. Honestly, everyone should have one in their freezer. It's my new gift that I will be giving to EVERYONE this year for birthdays.  HIGHLY recommend.","07 Jan 2017","Color: Purple","","Yes","Rally R.","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=24"
"Awesome product. Don't waste money on more expensive options","I love this thing! I read a lot of reviews for this type of product and found a wide range of prices. I'm so glad I went with this one and did not pay over $15 as many of the competitors cost. I was nervous from reviews that this wouldn't be cold enough or stay cold for long enough- but it really works great. I use this for my face so while rolling you just need to be sure to rotate the piece a full 360 degrees. Your face is small, so going back and forth on your cheeks or forehead only exposes a small section of the roller causing it to warm faster. Anyway, I highly recommend. My only wish is that the whole thing was smaller- like I said since I only use this for my face it would be nice to be able to get around my nose and eyes more easily with a smaller roller piece. If you are using this for sore muscles elsewhere it will be perfect.","24 Aug 2016","Color: Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71osh2f4T8L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Sabrina Richards","5.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=24"

As others have mentioned, the metal barrel does make a horrible screeching sound, but I just added a dab of coconut oil to the little divet it fits into and it fixed it for me. The handle is pretty cheap feeling but I wasn’t expecting much better for such a low price. I plan on buying these as stocking stuffers when Christmas rolls around.","27 Mar 2019","Color: Two roller - Grey","","Yes","Crystal Lake","4.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=26"

"Overall good product, but jagged edge at the seam makes it painful to use","It's a simple product that does what it promises.  It's very cold and wakes up the face and the mind, which is nice in the mornings!  My only complaint is that at the seam, it wasn't smooth--there was a piece of plastic sticking out at the seam where it wasn't finished correctly.  I tried to fix it by cutting most of it off with scissors, but it's still not completely smooth, which makes it kind of rough and a little painful to use.

It was also bigger then I expected, but still did the job on taking down the puffy. The eye masks have never worked for me unless I press it into my eye, doesn’t that defeat the purpose of having a strap to put on your head?? I can imagine using this on sore muscles as well when the time comes for that :) I’ve only used it a few times, the first time I stuck the whole thing in the freezer and it’s not as enjoyable if you just simply take it apart.

So far I haven't had any issues with re-attaching after cooling the ice roller. One thing to know though is that the ice roller can accidentally pop out if you apply too much pressure on it - but again no issues with putting it back in. This has really been so convenient for the summer heat and unexpected humidity of the year. I enjoy using it and so does my mom.

That means I get firm pressure when rolling and that's even better than I imagined. Great on a hot night. While I don't know if it's actually doing anything to my skin, my face definitely feels taut after using. I figure if cold compresses work on undereye bags, this must be doing SOMETHING, right? Easy to store in the freezer to grab when I want it, and when I'm done using it I wash with gentle soap and water and pop it back in for next time.

The second being I really dont like the noise it makes when I move it around especially when I have a migraine which is why I purchased it in the first place. The third thing is I wish it would stay cool longer. I keep it in the freezer for a good amount of time and the first few minutes it's really cold then it dies down. It does stay cold for a while just not that really good cold it has for the first few minutes. It's not the cutest at all qnd o wish the handle material was a better material. I really do like this product regardless of the flaws. It's a good price and very relaxing even when I dont have a migraine. It's a good size and comfortable to hold.

"BEWARE: Leaked Gel that irritated and stuck to my skin","When it arrived, it wasn't packaged in anything but the box. It didn't come in a plastic bag or protective lining inside the box. The ""clear"" or gel roll accessory was attached to the handle and had leaked all over the inside of the box. when I pulled it out it stuck to my hands. I didn't think much of it at first as I was just trying to figure out where it was leaking from and trying to clean up until my hands started burning. I immediately began scrubbing my hands with soap and water for over a minute. I did this about 3 times because when I dried my hands the gel was still dried onto my hands like super glue and not coming off. I repeated washing it again with soap and very hot water. My hands still sting as of right now, but I am hopeful it will go away. Clearly the gel inside the roller is toxic. I froze the metal roll accessory piece and that seems to work best instead.

Can't say it's a miracle wrinkle cure, but it feels like it stimulates the skin, the way being out in snowy cold weather would.  Face feels really warm after you're finished the cold massage.

In reading other comments, it seems the freezing gel may cause a reaction for some. If you're looking for ~*stunning bright red eye bags*~ and a casually peeling face, go for it. But I'd recommend a more gentle product if you've had any skin sensitivity or irritation in the past.","21 Nov 2020","Color: Blue","","Yes","pea.bea","2.0","ESARORA Ice Roller for Face & Eye, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief and Minor Injury, Skin Care Products","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E8IZ4ZA?linkCode=ogi&tag=cosmopolitan_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10049.g.38666976%5Bsrc%7C%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cf5476327-d8c1-4e0a-81c3-fd7e0c3353f8&pageNumber=69"

Makes my skin look so refreshed and it works on my eyes puffiness but it's not the right size for the eyes which makes it a little tricky there.
