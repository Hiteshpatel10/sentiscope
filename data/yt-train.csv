"cute ""time-lapse"" that is clearly cut numerous times to make the home made clock appear to be ""perfectly accurate"". when you demoed it in the clip before, the minute hand had a smooth motion yet it spontaneously became herkie jerky for the time-lapse. and if you watch closely, the standard clock hitches every time a minute passes. I'm sure if you spent more time on finessing the clock you built you could actually have a wonderfully smooth result, but due to your lack of pride in your craftsmanship you posed a shoddy result as a ""flawless"" piece.",2023-02-15T07:18:19Z,NK Stallion,1,1

"First of all, this is a very cool end result and really nice of you to share it with us. I watched it and was moved to think about how I could do similar things, and it was informative about the steps involved and had a pleasant end result.  So my concerns below are about replicating the same project in my own life:

It's pretty cool that it is possible to order a PCB board starting at $0 if someone has the time to design it themselves.  For the part where you design a gerber file for a custom PCB -  for someone who's never designed a gerber file like me, and has other responsibilities and doesn't yet know electronics, I looked up how many hours it would take to get to the level of competence to do this without any outsourcing, and it seems to be about 160-240 which is about 4-8 weeks full time.  It it possible for anyone to learn these skills if they have the time to fit it into their life.

In my case I would be inclined to use Fiverr to speed up the custom PCB creation step which is not an option right now, however I think it is important to be realistic and strategically work with other designers such as on CAD files for 3D printing and on PCB design.  The idea itself is really cool, and I am impressed by the finished product and thankful that you shared it.",2023-02-14T04:51:23Z,Robert Viragh,1,1

"Mind blown!!! 

Recently I saw a similar looking ring-clock but in a more classic fassion: there was a static vertical bar comming from the top of the ring to the center, holding a regular clock mechanism. When I saw it I thought it would be awesome if the minute hand was actually connected to the ring and moving, with an adjusted mechanism for the hour hand on the ""center end"" of the minute hand - a few days later I see this in my Recommended list :D

"I'm wondering if there's a way to make both hands magnetic, or if the magnetic fields will just be too likely to overlap whenever the minute hand passes over the hour hand. Maybe with a buffer zone between the two... but then, of course, you'd need something else to hold up the center point, negating the premise of the ""hollow"" clock. I mean, it's still pretty impressive looking even if you use a clear background, you just can't put your hand through it... But then, if both hands used magnets, you could completely hide the mechanical workings of the clock (right now, you can still see the circles turning if you know where to look).

I'm might be having way too much fun backseat engineering this clock, heh. The current product is amazingly cool as is, it's just that to my brain, once I saw the magnet solution for the hour hand... whelp.",2023-02-13T03:46:19Z,"Karin [CAR-in, not CARE-en]",0,2

Some miniatures are actually available at online sites but they are not like same or either so costly, so its my request that please can you help me with some of your views and ideas with this and creating an ARC-REACTOR which is non-3d printed, cheap cost ,looks and glows same, easily usable, less problematic.
