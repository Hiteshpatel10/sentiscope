Prefectly.
"First of all, this is a very cool end result and really nice of you to share it with us. I watched it and was moved to think about how I could do similar things, and it was informative about the steps involved and had a pleasant end result.  So my concerns below are about replicating the same project in my own life:

It's pretty cool that it is possible to order a PCB board starting at $0 if someone has the time to design it themselves.  For the part where you design a gerber file for a custom PCB -  for someone who's never designed a gerber file like me, and has other responsibilities and doesn't yet know electronics, I looked up how many hours it would take to get to the level of competence to do this without any outsourcing, and it seems to be about 160-240 which is about 4-8 weeks full time.  It it possible for anyone to learn these skills if they have the time to fit it into their life.

In my case I would be inclined to use Fiverr to speed up the custom PCB creation step which is not an option right now, however I think it is important to be realistic and strategically work with other designers such as on CAD files for 3D printing and on PCB design.  The idea itself is really cool, and I am impressed by the finished product and thankful that you shared it."
where can i buy this product?
"Looks good, but sorry to say the hands didn't match."
Very good idea. I'll make it. Thank you.
"Pretty neat, wondering if this design was ever used before in other clocks"
Insane
he didn't make it.
prefectly accurate
Mind blowing!
But Gen Z can't read the clock 😂
Amazing skills
using magnets was such a brilliant idea! naruhodo.
"actually i thought u can do both magnets, but then they will interferer"
Where's the missing hand?
is everything made out of arduino these days? Electronics used to be fun.
Amazing work and awesome product 👌
"I feel smart for guessing how it worked from the thumbnail. Ultimately though, easy guess, a magnet is pretty Much the only possible solution for this for factor. You could make the hour hand a circular pane of acrylic with a hand glued in or painted on it and rotate that, but that ruins a lot of the magic."
"без модуля реального времени с кварцевым резонатором никакой точности у часов не будет. хорошо если за сутки минута будет отставания или опережения, а могут и все 5. часы нужно доработать в этом плане"
"How to order, and how much?"
This will be perfect for a school project. Loving it.
No diagram information!
Can you add seconds ??
Very nice build... would you mind sharing the rotor cover with hour markings as well?
"fantastic build, but I still to this day can only read a digital clock, so i can't use this lol"
"I mean.... the clock is pretty cool, but the title seems to be taking a bit too much credit for this project and the comment section seems to have missed that too."
"Meh... the min hand is still in contact with the clock.
Talk to me when both the hands are floating and not touching anything. 🙄"
Amazing!!!!!
"Looks dope.
Amazing work Wrench 👏👏"
Take my money
Until you go to other countries with different time zone....
"With my DIY clock, I got an extra hour for today to spend"
"那裡怎沒看到
視頻怪怪的"
"Love from Amritsar, Punjab😘"
Jabardast
"Mind blown!!! 

Recently I saw a similar looking ring-clock but in a more classic fassion: there was a static vertical bar comming from the top of the ring to the center, holding a regular clock mechanism. When I saw it I thought it would be awesome if the minute hand was actually connected to the ring and moving, with an adjusted mechanism for the hour hand on the ""center end"" of the minute hand - a few days later I see this in my Recommended list :D 

Thank you Algorithm Overlord for that spark of joy! ;)"
I like how clever but simple the magnet part is
"That is going to drift out of time very fast.
You should add a RTC."
Nice 🙂👍
didn't he order green PCB but got white?
It looks like it can be a bit loud 🤔
How to buy this clock or can you make it for me. Please share the website of this project. Thanks
How much it costing to create this???
"As long as it's ""prefectly accurate"" I'm in."
"Hi Dear Sir 
Could you please sell all of parts in package ?
I'd like to get exactly samey clock to buy it .
Is it possible?
FR I"
"I thought he would glue some hands to acrylic discs and rotate them, but this design is much more ingenious and is actually hollow."
"I'm wondering if there's a way to make both hands magnetic, or if the magnetic fields will just be too likely to overlap whenever the minute hand passes over the hour hand. Maybe with a buffer zone between the two... but then, of course, you'd need something else to hold up the center point, negating the premise of the ""hollow"" clock. I mean, it's still pretty impressive looking even if you use a clear background, you just can't put your hand through it... But then, if both hands used magnets, you could completely hide the mechanical workings of the clock (right now, you can still see the circles turning if you know where to look).

I'm might be having way too much fun backseat engineering this clock, heh. The current product is amazingly cool as is, it's just that to my brain, once I saw the magnet solution for the hour hand... whelp."
That is amazing 💪
Its good widio
"This project is great. It's one of those there where it's simple and makes sense, but it just messes with your mind."
"Hello.  
Please excuse me, but I did not see (did not find) a link to the firmware for Arduino Nano.  Please tell me where I can find it. 
 And, I apologize for my English - Google translator is sometimes naughty. 🤪"
I stopped watching the video from first of all I printed the parts using my 3d Printer :)
Prefect!
Not bad. I'd improve it with an ESP32 instead and use NTP to get the current time.
"Looking at such videos and Intelligent people, I keep believing that time travel is possible."
This is awesome!
"Amazing. The way you used the magnets is so ingenious!
Absolutely fantastic!"
amazing
Looks good but definitely not perfectly accurate🙃
"Prefectly accurate! No seriously, looks amazing ;)"
"y'know what would be sexy? some 3d printed numbers glued on, a lil lcd showing the precise time (at the bottom instead of the microcontroller panel) and some backlight"
"saw a version of that the other day, it had both hands mounted to an acrylic plate and being moved by magnets. but it was bulky af, probably so that the magnets don't interfere? this version is much more elegant!"
"Cool, but not accurate (according to time lapse)"
sexy!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I desinged something very similar to this like 15 years ago. I never made it because 3D printing wasn't a thing back then and getting the parts made in a workshop would have cost $$$$$. How 3D printers have changed the world for the at-home designer!
Bro do u ever sell these ? Anyone ??? I really need one
Fake
pure genius
"такие вещи надо делать на часах реального времени! и должен быть датчик холла или оптический датчик , который будет компенсировать неточнось механики раз в час или раз в 12 часов."
"very nice idea, but i thnk that the time it s not accurate,"
Does the Arduino handle daylight savings time?
"Would it be possible to build this, but have the hands mounted to a piece of acrylic in the middle, with no signs of support, and BOTH hands controlled by magnets? Or would the magnets interfere with both hands operating independently?"
you need to manufacture this and sell so i can buy..

Really clean build (and desk!)
"I was thinking magnets when I saw the thumbnail, it's neat to see I was right."
the original design is very clever
Love the clock. But the electronic aspect seems unnecessary. Could be done with a simple DC motor and a resistor instead of a stepper and arduino. Although it's an excellent exercise with coding! Great work
"So he found a design online and decided to make a sponsored video about him making it, with affiliate links in the description. While not illegal, this method of making money isn't very ""clean"" in my opinion"
Very creative and excellent work
printed circuit board boards
Wonderful 👍
Cool project .... sweet use of the magnets
I would buy it
"I just searched the video to know the mechanism behind the slow moving hand ,
Then the use of magnets just blowen my Mind.Hats off to ur engineering n idea"
"Just looking at the thumbnail, my guess is two motors, one in the center to move the hour hand counter to the minute hand, which moves with a ring around the full edge. That sounds nuts and I can’t wait to see how it’s actually done

Edit: oh my god that’s genius"
Great engineering bro 😁
"Me: wow this looks cool lets see how to make it
The Wrench: step 1. Lets use the 3d printer
Me: ok, bye have a great time"
"Cool. But sorry, why did you used a stepper, it would be cheaper using a dc Motor with speed tuned to match clock rotation. Much cheaper and easier"
"If the black connector of the minute hand is replaced by transparent connector , it would have given little more better"
Thank you rajaj! That was very entertaining
Which shouldering iron do you  use
Insanely creative man!!!!
Cool design
God job! Greate video!
Wow. You printet and assembled someone elses prosject.
Plz make some more lattepanda mini portable slimmer laptop and do a showcase with playing Minecraft java or genshin impact or asphalt 9 plzz I miss them
I want buy this product ... How much????
"if i had a 3d printer, i'd try this."
Is the clock now working. I know one of them the people had issues with
Where can I buy this?
"ну такое себе, лучше бы сделать чтоб стекло вращалось вместе с часовой стрелкой, а минутная двигалась магнитом - тогда будет сложно визуально понять за счёт чего движутся стрелки и это создаст должный эффект."
This channel has really grown since the last time I've seen it. I still remember the mini pc video lol.
cool！
Great idea!
Amazing ideas
Great video and a super cool clock. I've got a Jefferson golden hour mystery clock that's almost 70 years old. It's still working fine and keeps good time with its 50Hz replacement motor. The principle is the same but the Jefferson has style as well as function.
Can u give me link for that soldering iron please ...
When I was a baby boy I couldn't read the clock hands and my school teachers were like what in the world and I was also wondering why the hell the clocks on the hands just show numbers  but when the first smart phones came out I knew I was from the future that was 32 years later.
Magnifique bravo à toi
"What I love most about it is the simplicity of the magnet. When seeing the thumbnail, i was already over engineering it in my head thinking about how the rotation of the minute hand would  be geared up in the center so that it moved the hour one…"
legends are watching without 3d printer
You can sell it commercially
"Nice project.
But it's 1 second off."
sell your product on amazon
0:26 with just the first step i left the project
Awesome
Very genius design..i liked it 🔥
👍
"Lookup cartier magic clock, its even better"
👍 👍 👍
"Absolutely ingenious.  And a fantastic build, too!"
"Nice idea.
When designing a PCB that I know I won't be using connectors, I prefer providing a hole to have the wires pass through or a double hole to use a pvc wire strap."
You know what would sell the illusion even more? Printing that black gear with clear plastic.
"I remember when I realized something like this was possible! Glad someone who could make it did too!
Edit: my idea used some form of mechanical linkage through the minute hand to drive the hour hand though"
I love this one . For real
"That is awesome, wow. Could you have two rings with magnets, one for each pointer?"
what study did you do to have this expertise
pERfectly.
"If the connection from the outer ring to the minute hand was transparent, it would really look like magic"
"Sick design, good works"
Love the idea of magnets - possibly next idea is glue the centre onto the back .... ?
Amazing  work man  ..I have downloaded the files but I can't find the Arduino code !?
Hey @TheWrench...should I use SLA or FDM technology ?!
I have a Vintage 1950s Jefferson Art Deco Golden Hour Mystery Clock. It works differently but gives the same illusion.
"Rechargeable Battery version... Coming soon?
Looks very wonderful to be true."
Make a video On diy infinity stones
Invention
Поставь подсветку неоновую по кругу будет круто!
This is just wow! Amazing!
Combine this with a Dyson bladeless fan and you're golden
Very brilliant idea
"v cool, the effect is really striking, and i feel dumb for expecting some elaborate linkage or servo system and not just magnets"
I wanna buy it. 😍
"MəşəAllah.
Mükəmməl iş."
That could make money.
Can you send the pcb link too
awesome
Good!
"That’s beautiful.
How did you make the hands take steps in the end?"
you could probably go magnet-less if you hide gears for turning red inside the black clock hand
Very good well done my friend🙂🤝🤝🤝
"Incrível, você acabou de ganhar mais um inscrito no canal"
Super like boss
Ok that's nice ...
"Things you need
1. 3D printer"
Why don't you sell these products like on Amazon
"Next project, the hollow bathroom"
invest
next time make tensa zangetsu clock...💀💀
Hi
Very nice. Can you please tell me the name of the soldering iron?
Invisible pc build please 🥺
Great project
I’m not seeing the minute hand. I see the one hand sweep around and around but I don’t see the minute hand.
I have to print this!!!!!! Amazing
"That is quite clever, but if I ever get around to making one, I think I'll limit it to two moving parts, or parhaps three, including a second hand. I'm not quite sure how easy that would be."
cool but it does not tell the time lol
Good clock
I guess your clock is too noisy
"Concept cool, but not really telling time more of a sculpture I wouldn't call it a clock without a more advanced design."
Please sel me
Wow 🤯
you should sell this clock online Trust me You become milliner.
how you know the minutes?
Such a lovely and my favourite 😍 channel in my school days onwards
Awesome 😎👍
Give me this 🙂
Cooolll !!!
bro needs to patent the idea
Thats so amazing!!
My gf now wants a Hollow Cock. I mean clock
nice
"Hey! Wrench I love watching your videos, and I am also kept creating such DIY stuff inspired by you the thing is nowadays I am planning to mod and convert my old boring pc cabinet to a very interesting and my most favourite theme that is IRONMAN theme pc cabinet and I actually have planned everything very nicely, the place where I stuck is that I want a miniature of an ARC-REACTOR at the front side of my cabinet which should look similar to the one in the movies and also glows like the same bluish color whenever I want. Some miniatures are actually available at online sites but they are not like same or either so costly, so its my request that please can you help me with some of your views and ideas with this and creating an ARC-REACTOR which is non-3d printed, cheap cost ,looks and glows same, easily usable, less problematic. Thank you. LOVE YOU 3000💙💛❤."
Китайцам покажите. Через день на али появятся.
how long can that little magnet last? more than 5 years?
WHY NO RTC
Really cool.
So cool🤩
"Magnets, that's a simple, yet elegant solution and way less complex than what I had in mind, which is running a thin rod through the center of the large arm and stick a diagonal gear to it which would spin the small arms diagonal gear"
your are genius 😮😮
I wish i had 3d printer
Cool
"This is a reproduction of Jefferson golden hour clock , very popular  in US 1950 period. 
We can still get from US vintage market."
Really nice. Many congratulations. 👍
Nice
"Short crisp intelligent ,both video and invention"
Wow
Amazing
So cool
Bro how much it cost it to make you these
VERY NICE PROJECT:) FROM YOO PROJECTS
bro you are unique love you bro❤
Bro please make an Air conditioner
Amazing clock
"Good concept but, it might be bether  if you add a RTC and some encoders and maybe some buttons to set the time, without the need to reprogram the arduino"
👍
Nice video Big Brother Love From India 🇮🇳
how to set time
"great, but it doesn't really tell the real time, you should add RTC real time clock module or using nodemcu for getting the time from the internet.
but still nice to watch"
Amazing work bro!!!
Wow very cool
Amazing idea
How to tell minutes.... It's only showing hours
Plsss give me this product
Menu v bnaado sir
Nice
This Hollow Clock Idea is Amazing and I Definitely tried this Hollow Clock From My Home😉
Bhai kuch esa bna jo sab bana apye simple phaltu ka chochala nahi bana 3d printer
Wow Amazing.👊💗
"Do you know why YouTube didn't support diy videos ? I think it is only with me.... I have a channel named @sarvagnaraval
... I uploaded more than 100 videos.... Also my video quality is good...and ideas also... But i didn't know why YouTube didn't support it 😩 ghor kalyug hai bro 😆"
looks awesome
Can you make a small ATM with bill and coin recognition!? (for personal use)
Nice project
I'm
It was looking great and porfunce to
You can use rgb in this clock behind or inside
Please give this master piece 💕
Love it keep  up da good work
Clock asks bro what is time
Wasn't the driver needed?
"Brilliant work, dude! Really well done!!! 😃
Stay safe there with your family! 🖖😊"
"Thanks, 👍!"
Cool
Amazing!
"VERY GOOD

(  !!! PLEASE DO NOT ADD BACKGROUND MUSİC )"
More tiny pc builds pls
Price SIR
This is great for putting all the electronic at the bottom part. I thought there might be some wires in the upper ring.👍🏻
Hey Wrench I am from Pakistan and i wanted to know how is it like in India and do a Pc build or Pc review.
wheres the 3d printer ilnk?
Nice❤
Besttt
とても優れたデザインと機能👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
